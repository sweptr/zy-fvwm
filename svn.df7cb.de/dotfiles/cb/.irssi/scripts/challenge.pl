# This script needs "rsa_respond" out of the hybrid ircd to actually work.
# svn for that is svn+ssh://helium.oftc.net/svn/oftc-hybrid
# And you need to have an rsa keypair in your oper block. Create one with
# openssl genrsa -des3 1024 > oper-whatever.key
# openssl rsa -pubout < oper-whatever.key > oper-whatever.pub
# and send the .pub to your noc :)

# You have two settings to change after loading this script, just type
# /set challenge to see them. Then you can use it in the future to oper by
# typing /cr YOUROPERNICK
